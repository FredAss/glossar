See example 2 below.\n3.\tScenarios are created by the user requirements engineer based on results from observation and contextual interviews.\n4.\tPersonas and scenarios evolve together as thinking about users involves thinking about what they want to do, and thinking about activities involves thinking about who will be undertaking them.\n5.\tScenarios are reviewed by users to detect misunderstandings that may have occurred during contextual inquiry\n6.\tA scenario should avoid placing unnecessary constraints on the design by referencing specific objects, such as buttons, in the user interface.\n7.\tScenarios are used to create task models and early prototypes that support the tasks in the scenario.\nExamples of scenarios:\n1.\t\u201cJohn Miller is a business traveler who often takes flights in the course of a week. He prefers to take his car to the airport. But every now and then he misses a flight and then regrets not to have taken a taxi or the tram to the airport. He simply underestimates the car queues in front of the car park and the walking time to the gate.\u201d\nThis example corresponds to note 2a, the current situation.\n2.\t\u201cBefore going to the airport, John Miller checks the situation at the car park at the airport with his new application. If sufficient parking spaces are available, he reserves a place to park with his new application and then relaxedly drives to the airport with his car. He knows that since the application has been launched there is a separate entry for cars with reservations,\u201d\nThis example corresponds to note 2b, the anticipated situation.\n3.\tThe following text, which supplements the above example 2, is too specific and violates note 6: \n\"John Miller looks at the 'Overview of available park spaces' screen and selects a parking space by clicking the 'Select' button.
